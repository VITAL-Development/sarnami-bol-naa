# Changelog

All notable changes to this repo's **published content and settings**
(`content/sarnami/`, `settings/sarnami/`) are recorded here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
repo follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) via annotated git
tags — see [`docs/versioning.md`](docs/versioning.md) for the scheme and the
precise definition of what counts as a **breaking** (MAJOR) vs additive
(MINOR) vs fix (PATCH) change.

This log tracks **content and schema-relevant** changes — anything a
consuming server syncing this repo would care about (new/changed
vocab, units, lessons, or `language-settings.json` shape). Pure grammar-doc
or tooling edits that don't affect served content need not appear.

Releases are cut as git tags `vX.Y.Z`. There are no tags yet; the entries
below accumulate under `[Unreleased]` until the first release is cut, at
which point they move under a dated `## [X.Y.Z]` heading.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Content for `unit-11-loanwords` ("Leenwoorden & nieuwvormingen"), authored on
  top of the merged structure scaffold (#117, follow-up to #101). Source chapter:
  `authored_docs/byakaran/09-loan-words-and-neologisms.md`. Adds 21 loanwords in
  the new `content/sarnami/vocab/unit-11-loanwords.json` — Dutch, English and
  Sranantongo verb borrowings formed with the auxiliaries kare/hove (bel kare,
  klop kare, uitleg kare, beledig kare, bekeur kare, wachti kare, help kare,
  mooi kare, lūrū kare, būṭū bhare, don kare, lās kare, hambog kare, pharyam
  kare, riwŏrs kare, boro kare, trīkī kare, yūrū kare, morsū kare) plus two fully
  assimilated neologisms (lĕsiyāī, sĕtiyāve) — image-verified diacritics, tagged
  `book-pNN` + source-language + `needs-verification` (only `don` is confirmed by
  the second source `sarnamibhasa-vocab.md` and drops `needs-verification`), the
  lesson content in `content/sarnami/lessons/unit-11-loanwords.json` (grammar
  notes on the kare/hove pattern, Sranantongo-via-Dutch routing and
  volksetymologie + exercises), and wires up the scaffold's three lessons (Dutch
  / Sranantongo & other / review) with `newVocab`, `grammarNoteRefs` and
  `exercises`. Exercise mix per the issue: `flashcard`, `matching`
  (loanword↔origin/meaning) and `multiple-choice` in the two content lessons (no
  `word-bank`), and a review lesson mixing all five kinds with a higher
  `xpReward`.
- Content for `unit-03-sounds` ("Klanken & uitspraak"), authored on top of the
  merged structure scaffold (#109, follow-up to #93). Source chapter:
  `authored_docs/byakaran/01-sounds.md`. Adds 19 sound-example words in the new
  `content/sarnami/vocab/sounds.json` — vowel/consonant/diacritic examples drawn
  from the book's klinker/medeklinker tables (ām, insān, ultā, ainā, aurat,
  kaun, khet, cor, chūrī, phul, garīb, roṭī, ḍar, laṛkā, jhaṇḍā, kaiñcī, Laṅkā,
  bhāṣā, śānti — image-verified diacritics, tagged `book-pNN` +
  `needs-verification`), the lesson content in
  `content/sarnami/lessons/unit-03-sounds.json` (grammar notes on macrons,
  aspiration, retroflex onderpunt and nasale tilde + exercises), and wires up
  the scaffold's four lessons (vowels / consonants / diacritics / review) with
  `newVocab`, `grammarNoteRefs` and `exercises`. Exercise mix per the issue:
  `matching` (symbol↔sound), `multiple-choice` and `flashcard` in the three
  content lessons (no `word-bank`), and a review lesson mixing all five kinds.
- Content for `unit-00-about-sarnami` ("Over het Sarnami"), authored on top of
  the merged structure scaffold (#108, follow-up to #92): reading-led
  orientation notes and exercises in
  `content/sarnami/lessons/unit-00-about-sarnami.json`, and a small set of key
  terms / proper nouns in the new
  `content/sarnami/vocab/about-sarnami.json` (Sarnāmī, Sarnām, Hindustani,
  Bhojpurī, Avadhī, girmiṭ, Lalla Rookh — tagged `book-pNN` +
  `needs-verification`). The scaffold's three lessons are wired up with
  `newVocab`, `grammarNoteRefs` and `exercises`: heavy `multiple-choice`
  comprehension plus a few `flashcard`s in the reading lessons, and a review
  lesson mixing all five exercise kinds.
- A writing/romanization teaser lesson `unit-00-about-sarnami-writing`
  ("Schrift & romanisatie") in `content/sarnami/units/unit-00-about-sarnami.json`
  and `content/sarnami/lessons/unit-00-about-sarnami.json`: an at-a-glance look
  at the devanagari script and the scientific romanization (macrons, retroflex
  dots, nasalization, aspirated consonants) as a teaser for `unit-03-sounds`,
  plus a new key term `about-devanagari` (devanāgarī) in
  `content/sarnami/vocab/about-sarnami.json` (tagged `book-p29` +
  `needs-verification`) and a matching review exercise (closes #92).

### Changed

- Reassigned unit `order` values to fit the `authored_docs/lesson-plan.md`
  sequence as new units land: `unit-01-basics` 1 → 3 and `unit-02-adjectives`
  2 → 6 (`unit-00-about-sarnami` = 1 and `unit-03-sounds` = 2 unchanged). Unit
  **ids** are stable; `order` is only a sort key, so this is an
  additive/non-breaking change (see `docs/versioning.md`).
- `content/sarnami/vocab/greetings.json`: reworded two `notes` strings to drop
  an internal PR citation (same-shape notes-string edit; no schema or
  served-field change).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Grammar content (`content/sarnami/grammar/grammar.json`) for
  the consuming server's `GET /grammar` endpoint.
- Versioning policy (`docs/versioning.md`): SemVer via annotated git tags as
  the source of truth, breaking/non-breaking definitions tied to the on-disk
  content/settings schema, and how a git-sync deployment pins to
  a tag instead of tracking `main`. Also this `CHANGELOG.md`.
